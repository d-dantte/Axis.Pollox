1.   Remove all "virtual" modifiers from all entity properties in this library! see notes Axis.Europa for more information.
2.	 Go through all implementations and ensure that Validate() is called on all Pollux Entities before they interract with
	 the backend.

3.	 Add a AuditAwarePersistenceCommand implementation of the IPersistenceCommand interface that delegates to the Jupiter
	 implementation. This layer will be responsible for managing the "created by" and "modified by" process for objects
	 being persisted

1.	 Changing Axis.Pollux.Identity to now implement "Contacts" with UserData. The reson behind this is phone, email, etc may evolve
	 into new means of communication, or be changed totally. So to avoid changing the model, i will use the UserData
	 [Done]

2.	 Convert all DateTime to DateTimeOffset.

3.	 Implement the UserLogon with DateTimeOffset in mind
	
4.	 Modify the User object:
	 a. UniqueId will no more be a string, but a Guid.
	 b. all "foreign keys" pointing to this object will be modified to reflect the new Guid
	 c. UserId will be changed to UserName. This field should still be indexed at the back end, but it will no longer "EXCLUSIVELY" contain an "email".
	 d. Upon user creation, an email is supplied, as well as a user-name for the targeted user: these values may be identical; the email however, will
	    be stored in the "UserData" store/table along with other "contact data".
5.	Add Identity server implementation to this: Break this appart into another Project repository on it's own. This Server should be flexible enough to accept
	Services registration dynamically - thus a new microservice system can join in this server's realm on the fly.
	- Off the top of my head, this will require the services to host their own permission to avoid packing too much information into the token that is generated.
	- This will mean that each microservice system will have to expose certain endpoints (invalidate-logon, disable-role, etc) using a laid-down interface as
	  provided by the identity server. Thus changes in the identity server can be broadcast to all connected/registered microservice-systems.

6.	Add Execution Context that functions like the CallContext class. One can drop Key-Value pairs in it for acces by other processes down the execution chain
